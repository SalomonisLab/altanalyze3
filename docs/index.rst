AltAnalyze3 Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the AltAnalyze3 documentation!

AltAnalyze3 is an advanced Python3 workflow for long-read (LR) and short read splicing analysis. The software can integrate results across single-cell and bulk technological platforms, aligning to a common gene model for splice junction- (MultiPath-PSI) and isoform-based analyses (TPM or ratio). Both supervised and unsupervised (splice-ICGS) analyses are supported. Workflows can be run in a fully automated manner with or step-by-step with extensive customization. See tutorials for examples.
